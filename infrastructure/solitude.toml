# Solitude - Alpha's alarm clock configuration
# A little Solitude at Pondside.

[schedule]
# When the night shift begins (hour in 24-hour format, PST)
night_start = 22

# When the night shift ends (hour in 24-hour format, PST)
# This is EXCLUSIVE for regular heartbeats, but there's a special "last breath"
# that fires at exactly this time.
# Example: night_end = 5 means regular heartbeats through 4:40 AM, plus 5:00 AM last breath
night_end = 5

# Minutes between heartbeats
interval_minutes = 20
